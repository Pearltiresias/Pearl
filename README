Recently became surprisingly fascinated with the Linux command as part of a course I'm taking, "Google IT Support Certification" on Coursera as part of a desire to become a late bloomer as a Linux sysadmin.  I take suggestions, and a suggestion lately has been "go learn how to contribute to GitHub," so I'm following a tutorial to learn a little bit more than I knew yesterday.
